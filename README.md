# BLEU-Score

Calculates the BLEU evaluation metric

The German, Greek and Portuguese reference translations above are excerpted from the common test set of the EUROPARL corpus; the candidate translations were obtained by taking the corresponding English sentences and running them through Google Translate. The English reference translations are from two alternative translations of the Passover Hagaddah; the candidate translation was obtained by running the original Hebrew text through Google translate. The actual test will be done with similar files.
